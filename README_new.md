# Introduction

ðŸŽ¨ We propose an end-to-end multi-concept customization method, based on our RMP-Adapter pipeline: A Region-based Multiple Prompt Adapter for Multi-Concept Customization in Text-to-Image Diffusion Model.

âœ¨ What makes it cool? Our method leverages multiple prompt adapters (MP-Adapter) to extract pixel-level information from reference images of target concepts. Through our region-based denoising framework (RDF), we can precisely control where and how different concepts appear in the generated image.

ðŸš€ Check out our inference code and pre-trained models below. Now you can create amazing mashups of different concepts in your generated images!

# Release Plans
- [x] Inference codes and pretrained weights of RMP-Adapter
- [ ] Further Examples of Concept Customization Implementation
- [ ] Training scripts of RMP-Adapter
